## [v2.8.0] - eSignature API v18.3.02 - 2018-11-29
### Fixed
- Fixed a problem with the BulkEnvelopesApi.UpdateRecipients method that could cause it to return a "Value cannot be null.\r\nParameter name: stream" error rather than add bulk recipients to an envelope. (DCM-2137)
- Fixed a problem with the EnvelopesApi.listStatus methods that could cause them to ignore sets of envelope IDs passed in to get statuses for specific envelopes. (DCM-2953)
- Fixed a problem with the EnvelopesApi.updateChunkedUpload method that could cause it to fail and return a 411 error. (DCM-2978)
- Surfaced the authentication error that might be returned by the ApiClient.JWTUserToken method.

### Changed
- The SDK now supports version 18.3.02 of the DocuSign API.

### Added
- A jackson-dataformat-csv library has been added to the SDK. You can use this library to serialize Lists into CSV format.

## [v2.7.0] - eSignature API v18.3.00 - 2018-09-12
### Deprecated
- The ConfigureJwtAuthorizationFlowByKey method is now deprecated. Please use the RequestJWTUserToken method instead, which improves security by accepting the private key as a byte array or stream. (DCM-2763)
### Changed
- The base path for OAuth authentication is now a property of the ApiClient object. 
### Added
- Added a new method, RequestJWTUserToken. This method is passed a user's client id, user id, requested scopes, and their private key in byte array format, performs JWT authentication for the specified user, and returns an access token. (DCM-2763)
- Added a new method, RequestJWTApplicationToken. This is a reserved method that is only enabled by partners and resellers, which obtains an access token that makes requests on behalf of an application rather than a user. It is passed a user's client id, requested scopes, and a private key in byte array format, then returns an access token. (DCM-2763)
- SetOauthBasePath, which can be used to set the OAuth base path for your ApiClient.  (DCM-2731)
